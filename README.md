This repository contains an exhaustive list of plugins and themes published on
Omeka.org along with the information contained in `plugin.ini` and `theme.ini`.

It also contains the script that generates this list and it is launched
periodically by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org), so this is list is kept
up-to-date automatically.
